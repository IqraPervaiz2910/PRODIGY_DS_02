# PRODIGY_DS_02
## Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Objective:

To clean the dataset and perform exploratory data analysis to identify trends, patterns, and relationships between features.

### Dataset Used:

Titanic Dataset â€“ Kaggle

### Tools & Libraries:

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Seaborn

Matplotlib

### Steps Involved:

Loaded the Titanic dataset using Pandas.

Checked data structure, missing values, and data types.

### Handled missing data:

Filled missing age values with median age.

Filled or dropped missing values in columns like Embarked and Cabin.

Converted categorical variables (Sex, Embarked, etc.) into numerical values for analysis.

### Explored relationships between features such as:

Survival rate vs. Passenger class (Pclass)

Survival rate by gender (Sex)

Survival rate by age groups and family size

### Created visualizations:

Count plots to compare survival across categories.

Box plots and violin plots to show age distribution.

Heatmap to show correlation between numerical features.

### Key Insights:

Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males.

Passengers in first class were more likely to survive.

Children and those traveling with family had better survival chances.

Age, class, and gender were key predictors of survival.

### Skills Applied:

Data cleaning and handling missing values

Feature engineering and encoding

Data visualization for pattern discovery

Statistical summary and correlation analysis
